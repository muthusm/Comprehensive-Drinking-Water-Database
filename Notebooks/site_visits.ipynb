We resample this same site plus one upstream (800 Columbine) and downstream (700 Snowberry) samples. The sample results from 760 Columbine came back positive again. However the upstream and downstream properties results were negative. This triggered a Level 1 Assessment. We collected another set of samples from the inside of the condo at 760 Columbine, upstream, downstream and the outdoor hose bib on 8/21 /20. The results were negative. The positive bac &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; laboratory results indicate that the outdoor sample hose bib was the only contaminated sample point. It was used to connect a hose, which is where the positive total coliform originated.   Action Taken: The 760 Columbine road sample site outdoor hose bib was the only resample site that had a positive total coliform lab result. After investigating the property we found that the hose connected to the hose bib is used by the maintenance crew for every day use and not irrigation. The irrigation system has a   backflow device that passed its test in 2019. I informed the property manager to remove hose and disinfect the hose bib. No other action is needed at this time. We are looking to use a different sample point at this property in the future.</td>\n",

The standard operating procedure (SOP) for Total Coliform (TC) sample collection was followed which includes the disinfection of faucet surfaces with a disinfectant wipe and to flush water sufficiently to ensure water was representative of water in the main and not the service line. The latex gloves used by the sampler are to be sterile and wiped with sterile wipes after putting on and prior to sampling. Investigation after notification of the failed bacti tests revealed that the sterile wipes were old and partially dried out. The sample sites with the positive total coliform results were both businesses with very little usage due to the COVID19 pandemic. Free chlorine samples taken during sample collection were above the minimum limit but were lower than the average for the community. It was determined that the probable cause of the positive TC samples were the result of poor sampling technique and limited use of the water due to COVID19. Due to the facilities sampled being vacant to COVID19, the stagnant water in the service lines and the faucets created more than usual bio-growth that did not get removed during flushing. It is also suspected that the disinfection at the sample points was inadequate due to stagnate conditions and poor condition of the disinfectant wipes used. collecting the sample that could have allowed contaminants to get on the gloves. A new disinfectant wipe container was used for disinfection and all faucets were flamed prior to repeat sampling to ensure adequate disinfection. Gloves were sterilized with the new disinfectant wipes and more time was spent flushing to ensure the sample was representative of the main and not the service line. Update sampling SOP to modify sampling techniques for total coliform to include: All metal faucets will be  flamed for 30 seconds...</td>\n",

They replaced 2-vacuum breakers &amp;amp; installed low flow sprinkler heads prior to obtaining a Bac-T sample at the east side of the campground. While performing this maintenance, the irrigation system was isolated from the rest of the campground until complete. I do not believe the system was contaminated by this procedure. (work was performed within 1 week of sample on 4/17/2019) While inspecting the sample point of the positive Bac-T sample the irrigation box that the spigot is on was half full of water with visible signs of vegetation floating in it. The spigot was above that point near the cover. This spigot is used by visiting campers to hook up to the water supply. There is one at each campsite (located at east end of the campsite &amp;amp; is prone to water run off during heavy rains (according to the staff)). There are 4 campsites at this location that could be effected.  I also discussed the sampling procedure used by the owner/staff &amp;amp; found that their sampling procedure may have been flawed &amp;amp; could have contaminated the sample result. The use of a 5/8&amp;quot; RV hose to retrieve the sample along with insufficient disinfection of the spigot &amp;amp; hose would have contributed to the positive sample. Also the sample bottle top was placed into a dirty box where the hose, latex gloves &amp;amp; other tools are stored prior to the next disinfection. issues have been corrected.</td>\n",

THE CONNECT WAS INCORRECTLY LISTED AS INACTIVE, SO THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED. THE ELEVATED STORAGE TANK WAS OBSERVED. THE TOWN HAS A MAINTENANCE CONTRACT WITH SOUTHERN CORROSION. THEY PERIODICALLY CHECK THE VENT SCREEN ON THE TANK. PROJECT 16-00116 FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THE ELEVATED STORAGE TANK WAS COMPLETED IN 2016, BUT CERTIFICATION WAS NOT SUBMITTED. DBP RESULTS FROM 4Q2017 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER B01 EXCEEDED THE HAA5 MCL DURING 3Q017. BRAD AND BART REPORTED THAT THEY FLUSH THE WATER SYSTEM IN AN EFFORT TO LOWER DBP LEVELS BUTH THAT DBP LEVELS AT THE ENTRY POINT ARE OFTEN SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED DURING WARM MONTHS. BACTERIA SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED FROM THE SAME FOUR SITES EVERY MONTH. THE BACTERIA SAMPLE SITING PLAN HAS 32 BACTERIA SAMPLE SITES LISTED. I RECOMMENDED THAT BACTERIA SAMPLE SITES BE ROTATED ON A MONTHLY BASIS.   80% OF WATER SYSTEM HAS BEEN REPLACED IN LAST 10 YEARS.   \n",

Mohawk Valley School District is currently serving water that exceeds the locational running annual average Maximum Contaminant Level for Total Tri-Halomethanes.  2. According to the 01/05/2018 Preliminary Engineering Report produced by Taylor Engineering, changes were made in 2014 that were not approved by ADEQ. These changes include;  a. Alum/Polymer Injection -The Alum/Polymer Injection was eliminated due to high maintenance requirements of the clarifier and the chemical injection equipment.  b. Static Mixer &#191; The static mixer was removed due to equipment failure and was no longer needed without the alum/polymer injection.  c. Chlorine Injection &#191; Chlorine injection was eliminated at the clarified water wet well, media filter influent header and the storage cistern.  d. Intake Screen &#191; The raw water intake screen configuration and location was modified to its current location due to ongoing maintenance issues.  e. Turbidity/Chlorine Readers &#191; The turbidity and chlorine monitoring units were eliminated due to equipment failures.  f. Rate of Flow Valve &#191; The rate of flow switch was removed due to equipment failures.  g. Raw Water Flow Switch &#191; The raw water flow switch was removed from the system. The flow switch controlled the chemical injection equipment.   \n",

On 8/19/20 received a positive result. We resample this same site plus one upstream (800 Columbine) and downstream (700 Snowberry) samples. The sample results from 760 Columbine came back positive again. However the upstream and downstream properties results were negative. This triggered a Level 1 Assessment. We collected another set of samples from the inside of the condo at 760 Columbine, upstream, downstream and the outdoor hose bib on 8/21 /20. The results were negative. The positive bac &quot;T&quot; laboratory results indicate that the outdoor sample hose bib was the only contaminated sample point. It was used to connect a hose, which is where the positive total coliform originated.   Action Taken: The 760 Columbine road sample site outdoor hose bib was the only resample site that had a positive total coliform lab result. After investigating the property we found that the hose connected to the hose bib is used by the maintenance crew for every day use and not irrigation. The irrigation system has a   backflow device that passed its test in 2019. I informed the property manager to remove hose and disinfect the hose bib. No other action is needed at this time. We are looking to use a different sample point at this property in the future.   \n",
       "2153281  There were 2 total coliform-positive sample results during the July 2020 monitoring period. Required repeat samples were collected and were all total coliform-negative. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for Total Coliform (TC) sample collection was followed which includes the disinfection of faucet surfaces with a disinfectant wipe and to flush water sufficiently to ensure water was representative of water in the main and not the service line. The latex gloves used by the sampler are to be sterile and wiped with sterile wipes after putting on and prior to sampling. Investigation after notification of the failed bacti tests revealed that the sterile wipes were old and partially dried out. The sample sites with the positive total coliform results were both businesses with very little usage due to the COVID19 pandemic. Free chlorine samples taken during sample collection were above the minimum limit but were lower than the average for the community. It was determined that the probable cause of the positive TC samples were the result of poor sampling technique and limited use of the water due to COVID19. Due to the facilities sampled being vacant to COVID19, the stagnant water in the service lines and the faucets created more than usual bio-growth that did not get removed during flushing. It is also suspected that the disinfection at the sample points was inadequate due to stagnate conditions and poor condition of the disinfectant wipes used. collecting the sample that could have allowed contaminants to get on the gloves. A new disinfectant wipe container was used for disinfection and all faucets were flamed prior to repeat sampling to ensure adequate disinfection. Gloves were sterilized with the new disinfectant wipes and more time was spent flushing to ensure the sample was representative of the main and not the service line. Update sampling SOP to modify sampling techniques for total coliform to include: All metal faucets will be  flamed for 30 seconds...   \n",

They replaced 2-vacuum breakers &amp; installed low flow sprinkler heads prior to obtaining a Bac-T sample at the east side of the campground. While performing this maintenance, the irrigation system was isolated from the rest of the campground until complete. I do not believe the system was contaminated by this procedure. (work was performed within 1 week of sample on 4/17/2019) While inspecting the sample point of the positive Bac-T sample the irrigation box that the spigot is on was half full of water with visible signs of vegetation floating in it. The spigot was above that point near the cover. This spigot is used by visiting campers to hook up to the water supply. There is one at each campsite (located at east end of the campsite &amp; is prone to water run off during heavy rains (according to the staff)). There are 4 campsites at this location that could be effected.  I also discussed the sampling procedure used by the owner/staff &amp; found that their sampling procedure may have been flawed &amp; could have contaminated the sample result. The use of a 5/8&quot; RV hose to retrieve the sample along with insufficient disinfection of the spigot &amp; hose would have contributed to the positive sample. Also the sample bottle top was placed into a dirty box where the hose, latex gloves &amp; other tools are stored prior to the next disinfection. issues have been corrected.   \n",
