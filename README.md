# Comprehensive-Drinking-Water-Database
This database will be used by the research team at DWJL to answer issues concerning drinking water justice at the national, state, county, and community water system levels. This is important because it will  enable the team  to answer research questions or easily query filters, and aggregate drinking water data to respond to environmental concerns at various geographic scales. The database (CDWD) that directly contributes to the environmental justice assessment of drinking water quality in the United States which the DWJL is conducting. The database will have the capacity to query the data and find answers to research questions associated with drinking water via filters and various options related to assessing drinking water quality. Understanding different geographical scales and units of analysis are the greatest challenge. Also, one of the issues during the initial phase of developing the database is figuring out how to handle and align multiple datasets to aggregate information.

## Dataset
The dataset files from SDWIS are refreshed quarterly and were published in July'21 to reflect the latest SDWIS release. The most recent data about the facility evaluations, violations, and enforcement are contained in these files. The dataset download comes organized under a folder named SDWA Dataset on the echo website. Each zip file in this folder contains comma-separated (CSV) files. The folder has 11 files that provide national data for key EPA/State Drinking Water Dashboard metrics, which are some of the SDWIS data elements most commonly used in the enforcement and compliance program.
